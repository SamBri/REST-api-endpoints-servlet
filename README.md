# Status
There is a gap in the thought process of a possible mix of a servlet class extends HTTP Methods being laid as an api in a single definition, database triggers, session bags for objects i.e long time to live<br>

# Thought Process

Notes #1<br>
i am on an endpoint, with a session on set returning as json.<br>
i want to do something so that an expired session triggers something in the database.<br>

triggers<br>
HTTPS<br>

Notes#4<br>
i know that sessions stay alive because HTTP is stateless<br>
i know that sessions keep an object alive.<br>

i want to save money online behind a vault using sessions because till the session expires, the value is not lost, hence the vault wouldn't be open.<br>

Notes#2<br>
i want to do something so that a trigger calls a stored procedure to do something.<br>

i want to create an endpoint on POST to submit saving details.<br>

Notes#3<br>
i want to keep an object alive in a session bag.<br>
